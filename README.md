Herbivore properties

Size - How big it is
Speed - How fast it is (how large a move it can make)
Perception - How far away can it see food
Reproduction energy - How much does it need to eat to reproduce
life expectancy - How long will it live for

Size = How long you can go without starving - How fast you move
Speed = Needs more energy - Gets food quicker
Perception = Finds food easier, uses energy
Reproduction energy - How much energy is needed to reproduce-
